## Introduction

Slack Alert Integration is a simple solution to send alerts and notifications from your application to Slack channels. This can be useful for monitoring systems, notifying team members about important events, or providing updates on automated processes.

## Setup

To set up Slack Alert Integration, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies. (List them if applicable)
3. Configure your Slack workspace to allow incoming webhooks. You can do this by following the official Slack documentation on incoming webhooks (https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
4. Copy the webhook URL provided by Slack and configure it in your application.
5. Customize the alert messages and formatting according to your needs.

## Usage

Once you have set up the integration, you can start using this utility in your application to send alerts to Slack channels. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```python
# Example Python code to send a message to Slack
from slack_utils import SlackUtils

# Initialize SlackUtils with your Slack webhook URL and channel
slack = SlackUtils(slack_webhook_url='your-slack-webhook-url', channel='your-channel')

try:
    # Your code here...
    slack.send_info_message("This is an informational message.")
except Warning as w:
    # If a warning occurs, send a warning message to Slack
    warning_message = str(w)
    slack.send_warning_message(warning_message)
except Exception as e:
    # If an exception occurs, send an error message to Slack
    error_message = str(e)
    slack.send_error_message(error_message)
